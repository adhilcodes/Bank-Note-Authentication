# Bank Note Authentication
This is a end to end Machine Learning Project to authenticate by giving appropriate input. I have deployed it in Heroku with Python Flask backend.I have used docker in this     project

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.
